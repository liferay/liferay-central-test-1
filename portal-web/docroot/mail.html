<P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The new Message Board interface that went live on Feb 7, 2009 includes a
    number of features that users have been requesting.&nbsp; The Message Boards (Forums) were enhanced
    to integrate tighter with the social networking components that are being introduced into the community.&nbsp;
    Please take some time to login and look at the new interface.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">We have also implemented easier methods to get notifications on new message
    threads.&nbsp; As part of this migration process, each user will want to access the
    forums to update their email subscriptions (re-subscribe).&nbsp; </FONT></P>
                                      
<P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">A complete explanation of the new interface is provided in an interactive
