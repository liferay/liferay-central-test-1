Useful when paginating results. Returns a maximum of <code>end - start</code> instances. <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are not primary keys, they are indexes in the result set. Thus, <code>0</code> refers to the first result in the set. Setting both <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> to {@link com.liferay.portal.kernel.dao.orm.QueryUtil#ALL_POS} will return the full result set. When orderByComparator is specified, the query will include the given ORDER BY logic. When orderByComparator is absent and pagination is required (<code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are not {@link com.liferay.portal.kernel.dao.orm.QueryUtil#ALL_POS}), the query will include the default ORDER BY logic from ${entity.name}ModelImpl. If both orderByComparator and pagination are absent, for performance reason, the query will not have a ORDER BY clause, on returning the result set will be sorted on portal side by PK ASC order.
