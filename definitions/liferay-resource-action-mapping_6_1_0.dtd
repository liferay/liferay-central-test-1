<!--
The resource-action-mapping is the root of the deployment descriptor for a
resource action descriptor that is used to define actions that are supported
on portal resources such as portlets and models.
-->
<!ELEMENT resource-action-mapping (portlet-resource*, model-resource*,
resource*) >

<!--
The portlet-resource element defines the permissions of the portlet.
-->
<!ELEMENT portlet-resource (portlet-name, permissions?) >

<!--
The portlet-name element is the name of the portlet.
-->
<!ELEMENT portlet-name (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The permissions define the default permissions granted and unsupported to
community members, guests users, and layout managers.
-->
<!ELEMENT permissions (supports, community-defaults?, guest-defaults?,
guest-unsupported?, layout-manager?, owner-defaults?) >

<!--
The supports element defines the actions supported by this resource.
-->
<!ELEMENT supports (action-key*) >

<!--
The action-key element defines the name of the action. The name will be
translated as specified in Language.properties. For example, if the action key
is "VIEW", then the key in Language.properties will be "action.VIEW".
-->

<!ELEMENT action-key (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The community-defaults element specifies the actions that community members are
permitted to perform by default.
-->
<!ELEMENT community-defaults (action-key*) >

<!--
The guest-defaults element specifies the actions that guest users are permitted
to perform by default.
-->
<!ELEMENT guest-defaults (action-key*) >

<!--
The guest-unsupported element specifies the actions that guests are never
permitted to perform. This disables the ability to assign permissions for these
actions. Only define actions here if you wish to prevent anyone from granting
permissions to perform these actions.
-->
<!ELEMENT guest-unsupported (action-key*) >

<!--
The layout-manager element specifies the actions that layout managers are
permitted to perform. If omitted, then layout-managers are granted permissions
on all supported actions. If included, then layout managers can only perform
actions specified in this element.
-->
<!ELEMENT layout-manager (action-key*) >

<!--
The owner-defaults element specifies the actions that the creator of the
resource is permitted to perform. If omitted, then owners are granted
permissions on all supported actions.
-->
<!ELEMENT owner-defaults (action-key*) >

<!--
The model-resource element defines the permissions and social equity rules of
the model.
-->
<!ELEMENT model-resource (model-name, portlet-ref, permissions?,
social-equity?) >

<!--
The model-name element is the name of the model.
-->
<!ELEMENT model-name (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The portlet-ref element is the name of the portlet that the model belongs to.
-->
<!ELEMENT portlet-ref (portlet-name*) >

<!--
The social-equity element specifies the social equity mappings for different
actions that can be performed on the the model.
-->
<!ELEMENT social-equity (social-equity-mapping*) >

<!--
The social-equity-mapping element specifies the social equity values that
can be applied to a particular action on the model.
-->
<!ELEMENT social-equity-mapping (action-key, information-daily-limit?,
information-value?, information-lifespan?, participation-daily-limit?,
participation-value?, participation-lifespan?, social-activity-mapping?,
unique?) >

<!--
The information-daily-limit entity specifies the amount of added information
that can be applied to a user's social score on a daily basis.
-->
<!ELEMENT information-daily-limit (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The information-value specifies the value of contributing information.
-->
<!ELEMENT information-value (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The information-lifespan entity specifies the length of time this value can be
applied toward a user's social score.
-->
<!ELEMENT information-lifespan (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The participation-daily-limit entity specifies the amount of participation that
can be applied to a user's participation score on a daily basis.
-->
<!ELEMENT participation-daily-limit (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The participation-value entity specifies the value of participation.
-->
<!ELEMENT participation-value (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The participation-lifespan entity specifies the length of time this value can
be applied to a user's participation score.
-->
<!ELEMENT participation-lifespan (#PCDATA) >

-->
<!ELEMENT social-activity-mapping (#PCDATA) >

<!ATTLIST social-activity-mapping class CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!--
The unique element specifies if the action will provide value to the user's
score if it is performed more than once.
-->
<!ELEMENT unique (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The resource element specifies an external file that contains
resource-action-mappings.
-->
<!ELEMENT resource EMPTY >

<!--
The attribute file specifies the external file that should be loaded to define
resource actions.
