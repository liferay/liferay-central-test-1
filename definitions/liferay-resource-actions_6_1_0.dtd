<!-- 
The resource-action-mapping is the root of the deployment descriptor for a 
resource action descriptor that is used to define actions that are supported 
on portal resources such as portlets and models.
-->
<!ELEMENT resource-action-mapping (portlet-resource*, model-resource*,
resource*) >

<!-- 
The portlet-resource element defines the actions that are supported by the named
portlet. The portlet-resource also defines the default permissions granted to 
community members, guests and layout managers.
-->
<!ELEMENT portlet-resource (portlet-name, permissions?) >

<!--
The portlet-name element is the name of the portlet to which these permission
definitions will apply.
-->
<!ELEMENT portlet-name (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The permissions define the default permissions granted and unsupported to
community members, guests users and layout managers.
-->
<!ELEMENT permissions (supports, community-defaults?,
guest-defaults?, guest-unsupported?, layout-manager?, owner-defaults?) >

<!--
The supports element defines the actions supported by this resource.
-->
<!ELEMENT supports (action-key*) >

<!--
The action-key element defines the name of the action. The name should have
key-format to be translated in a language bundle resource. Many
actions such as VIEW, EDIT, CONFIGURATION, etc. are defined in the portal 
language bundles. Any new action keys must be defined in a language bundle and
have the form action.${action-key}.
-->

<!ELEMENT action-key (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The community-defaults element specifies the actions that community members are
permitted to perform by default.
-->
<!ELEMENT community-defaults (action-key*) >

<!--
The guest-defaults element specifies the actions that guest users are permitted
to perform by default.
-->
<!ELEMENT guest-defaults (action-key*) >

<!--
The guest-unsupported element specifies the actions that guests are not 
permitted to perform. This disables the ability to assign permissions for these
actions. Only define actions here if you wish to prevent anyone from granting 
permissions to perform these actions.
-->
<!ELEMENT guest-unsupported (action-key*) >

<!--
The layout-manager element specifies the actions that layout managers are 
permitted to perform. If omitted layout-managers are granted permissions on all
supported actions. If included then layout managers can only perform actions 
specified in this element.
-->
<!ELEMENT layout-manager (action-key*) >

<!--
The owner-defaults element specifies the actions that creator of the resource
are permitted to perform. If omitted owners are granted on all supported
actions.
-->
<!ELEMENT owner-defaults (action-key*) >

<!--
The model-resource element defines actions that are supported by the given
service builder generated models. The model-resource also defines default
permissions granted to community members, guests, layout managers. This element
can also specify default social equity rules on a model.
-->
<!ELEMENT model-resource (model-name, portlet-ref, permissions?,
social-equity?) >

<!--
The model-name element is the package name for the model to which these rules
will apply.
-->
<!ELEMENT model-name (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The portlet-ref element is the name of the portlet in which these rules will be
applied.
-->
<!ELEMENT portlet-ref (portlet-name) >

<!--
The social-equity element specifies the social equity mappings for different
actions that can be performed on the containing model resource.
-->
<!ELEMENT social-equity (social-equity-mapping*) >

<!--
The social-equity-mapping element specifies the social equity values that
can be applied to a particular action on this model resource
-->
<!ELEMENT social-equity-mapping (action-key, information-daily-limit?,
information-value?, information-lifespan?, participation-daily-limit?,
participation-value?, participation-lifespan?, unique?) >

<!--
The information-daily-limit entity specifies the amount of added information
that can be applied to a user's social score on a daily basis.
-->
<!ELEMENT information-daily-limit (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The information-value specifies the value of contributing information.
-->
<!ELEMENT information-value (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The information-lifespan entity specifies the length of time this value can be
applied towards a users social score.
-->
<!ELEMENT information-lifespan (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The participation-daily-limit entity specifies the amount of participation that
can be applied to a user's participation score on a daily basis.
-->
<!ELEMENT participation-daily-limit (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The participation-value entity specifies the value of participation.
-->
<!ELEMENT participation-value (#PCDATA) >

<!-- 
The participation-lifespan entity specifies the length of time this value can
be applied to a user's participation score.
-->
<!ELEMENT participation-lifespan (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The unique element specifies if the action will provide value to the user's
score can if it is performed more than once.
-->
<!ELEMENT unique (#PCDATA) >

<!--
The resource element specifies an external file that contains 
resource-action-mappings.
-->
<!ELEMENT resource EMPTY >

<!--
The attribute file specifies the external file that should be loaded to define 
resource actions.
