[Liferay Portal](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-portal)
=================

Liferay Portal is an open source enterprise web platform for building business solutions that deliver immediate results and long-term value. It started out as a personal development project in 2000 and was open sourced in 2001.

To get started, check out the project's community homepage at http://liferay.org!

Source Code
-----------
Liferay's main source code resides in two repositories: [liferay-portal](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal) and [liferay-plugins](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins).  Additional repositories include:

* [Documentation](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs)
* [Liferay IDE](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-ide)
* [AlloyUI](https://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui)
* [Maven Support](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-maven-support)
* [Liferay Faces](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces)
* [Git Tools for Liferay](https://github.com/liferay/git-tools)

Liferay's releases are built from the `liferay-portal` repository, along with a select few plugins from the `liferay-plugins` repository.  

To build Liferay yourself you must build at least the `liferay-portal` repository.  You can optionally build plugins from the `liferay-plugins` repository, or build any of the other supporting technologies by visiting any of the above repositories and reading the instructions.

Quick start
-----------

To quickly get up and running, [download a pre-built Liferay release](http://liferay.com/downloads) and follow the [Quick Start](http://liferay.com/quick-start).
