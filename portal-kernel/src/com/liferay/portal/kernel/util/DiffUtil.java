 *
 * <p>
 * This class can compare two different versions of a text. Source refers to the
 * earliest version of the text and target refers to a modified version of
 * source. Changes are considered either as a removal from the source or as an
 * addition to the target. This class detects changes to an entire line and also
 * detects changes within lines, such as, removal or addition of characters.
 * Take a look at <code>DiffTest</code> to see the expected inputs and outputs.
