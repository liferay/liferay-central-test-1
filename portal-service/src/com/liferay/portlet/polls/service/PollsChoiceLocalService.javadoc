			<p>
				ServiceBuilder generated this class. Modifications in this class will be
				overwritten the next time is generated.
			</p>

			<p>
				This interface defines the service. The default implementation is
				{@link com.liferay.portlet.polls.service.impl.PollsChoiceLocalServiceImpl}}.
				Modify methods in that class and rerun ServiceBuilder to populate this class
				and all other generated classes.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
